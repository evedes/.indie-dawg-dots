# neovim

Minimal Neovim configuration for macOS using Neovim 0.12+ native package management (`vim.pack.add`). No lazy.nvim or other plugin managers.

## Key Patterns

- **Plugin loading**: `init.lua` iterates `lua/plugins/` and auto-requires every `.lua` file. No manual registration needed — just add a file.
- **Plugin keymaps live with their plugin**: Each plugin file in `lua/plugins/` contains its own keymaps. Only general-purpose keymaps go in `config/keymaps.lua`.
- **Colorscheme loads before plugins**: `config/colorscheme.lua` is required explicitly in `init.lua` before the plugins loop to ensure highlight groups are available.
- **No lazy.nvim**: Uses Neovim 0.12's built-in `vim.pack.add` for plugin management.
- **Filetype-deferred plugins**: Plugins that only matter for specific buffers wrap their whole body (including `vim.pack.add`) in `require("util.lazy").on_filetype(fts, fn)`, so they don't load on unrelated startups. The helper runs `fn` once on the first matching buffer, on the next tick via `vim.schedule` (filetype detection runs inside a `vim._with` textlock where `vim.pack.add` is disallowed). Currently used by `mkdnflow.lua` (`markdown`) and `autotag.lua` (web/markup filetypes). `markview.lua` and `markdown-preview.lua` are left eager — they're already effectively lazy (≈0 ms startup cost).
- **`with_desc()` helper** in `keymaps.lua`: Returns merged options table with description for mini.clue integration.

## Adding a Plugin

1. Create a new file in `lua/plugins/` (e.g., `lua/plugins/my-plugin.lua`)
2. Use `vim.pack.add` to declare the plugin, then call its setup and define keymaps:
   ```lua
   vim.pack.add {
       "https://github.com/author/plugin-name",
   }
   require("plugin-name").setup()

   vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>xx", function() ... end, { desc = "My action" })
   ```
3. It will be auto-loaded on next restart. No changes to `init.lua` needed.

## Adding a which-key Group

To add a description for a `<leader>` key group, add an entry to the `add()` call in `lua/plugins/which-key.lua`:
```lua
{ "<leader>x", group = "GroupName" },
```
which-key automatically picks up `desc` fields from `vim.keymap.set(...)` calls, so individual mappings don't need to be registered manually.

## Health Check & Tool Install

The config expects a set of external tools (language servers, formatters, ripgrep/fd). Two ways to verify and install them:

- **In-editor**: `:checkhealth dotfiles` (or `:DotfilesHealth`) reports which expected tools are present/missing. Defined in `lua/dotfiles/health.lua`.
- **Terminal**: `scripts/nvim-doctor` checks and installs.
  - `nvim-doctor` / `nvim-doctor check` — report installed vs missing.
  - `nvim-doctor install` — install everything missing (auto-detects macOS/brew vs Arch/pacman/yay; uses npm/cargo/rustup where appropriate).
  - `nvim-doctor list` — list every managed tool and its install recipe.

The tool list is duplicated in `lua/dotfiles/health.lua` and `scripts/nvim-doctor`; keep the two in sync when adding/removing a server or formatter.

## Formatting

- `conform.nvim` formats on save (toggle `vim.g.autoformat`). Formatters per filetype live in `lua/plugins/conform.lua`.
- **JS/TS/JSON use Prettier only** — `dprint` was removed as a JS/TS/JSON formatter to keep formatting deterministic (no two formatters competing in one chain). The `dprint` LSP (`lsp/dprint.lua`) is still enabled for json/graphql.
- `<leader>up` toggles Prettier's built-in default args (used only when no project Prettier config is found).

## Diagnostics

Diagnostics are configured in `lua/lsp.lua`. Three display modes cycle via `<leader>uD` or `:DiagnosticMode` (or `:DiagnosticMode {mode}` to set one directly):

| Mode | Virtual text | Gutter signs | Use when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `inline` (default) | on (icon + source + code) | off | everyday coding |
| `quiet` | off | on (gutter glyphs) | reading prose, focused work |
| `float` | off | off | use `gl` on demand only |

`gl` opens the diagnostic float in any mode; `[e`/`]e` jump between errors; `<leader>xd` sends diagnostics to the quickfix list.

## Leader Key

Space. Local leader is comma.

## Git Workflow

The Git stack is split by granularity — each tool owns a layer, so don't add overlapping git plugins; extend the matching one.

| Tool | Role | Keymaps |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gitsigns.nvim` | Per-hunk / per-line: stage, reset, preview, blame + gutter signs | `]h` / `[h`, `<leader>gs` / `gr` / `gS` / `gu` / `gp` / `gb` |
| `diffview.nvim` | Full-file / multi-file review and history | `<leader>gd` (open), `gh` (file history), `gx` (close) |
| `neogit` | Magit-style status, staging, committing | `<leader>gg` |
| `mini.diff` | Inline working-tree overlay in the buffer | `<leader>go` |
| built-in `:DiffTool` | Ad-hoc local diff (`:DiffTool {file}`) | `<leader>ud` |

Use `gitsigns` for quick in-buffer hunk actions, `diffview` to review a changeset or history before committing, `neogit` for the staging/commit flow, and `mini.diff` to see line-level changes overlaid on the file.

## Markdown Workflow

The Markdown stack is split three ways — each job has exactly one owner. Before adding a Markdown plugin, check it doesn't overlap one of these roles; extend the existing one instead.

| Plugin | Role | Owns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mkdnflow.nvim` | Navigation & editing | links, backlinks, todos, heading/link jumps, move/rename source |
| `markview.nvim` | In-editor rendering | how Markdown *looks* while editing (headings, lists, tables, code via conceal) |
| `markdown-preview.nvim` | Browser preview | external/WYSIWYG rendering in a browser tab |

Navigation & editing (`mkdnflow.nvim`):

- `<CR>` follows or creates Markdown links; `<BS>` / `<Del>` move back and forward through mkdnflow history.
- `<Tab>` / `<S-Tab>` jump between links; `]]` / `[[` jump between headings.
- `<leader>ml` creates a Markdown link from text/selection; `<leader>mL` creates one from the clipboard.
- `<leader>mb` opens backlinks; `<leader>mB` refreshes backlinks.
- `<leader>mx` toggles Markdown task status.
- `<leader>mr` renames/moves the current source and updates links.
- Markdown link creation is configured for flat kebab-case `.md` files to match the Multiverse vault.

Rendering & preview:

- `<leader>mt` toggles in-editor rendering (`markview.nvim`).
- `<leader>mp` toggles browser preview (`markdown-preview.nvim`).

## Multiverse Vault Pickers

`lua/plugins/multiverse.lua` adds Snacks pickers hard-scoped to the notes vault (`~/Nextcloud/Multiverse`), so notes are reachable from any project without changing the session's cwd. The `<leader>n` keys take `cwd` as a one-off argument — they do not `cd` the session.

- `<leader>nf` — find a note by filename.
- `<leader>n/` — live grep across all notes.
- `<leader>nr` — recently edited notes, sorted by mtime (catches notes changed outside Neovim via a custom finder).
- `<leader>nb` — backlinks: grep the vault for links to the current note (picker-based, preferred over mkdnflow's `<leader>mb`).

snacks is `require`d lazily inside each mapping because this file may load before `snacks.lua` adds snacks to the pack path (plugins are auto-required in alphabetical order).

## Pre-Commit Rule

Before creating a commit, review and update this CLAUDE.md to reflect any structural changes (new/removed/renamed files, plugins, keymaps, patterns, or dependencies).

## Dependencies

- Neovim >= 0.12 (for `vim.pack.add`)
- Git (for plugin fetching)
- ripgrep (for mini.pick grep)
- Language servers + formatters listed by `scripts/nvim-doctor` (install with `nvim-doctor install`)
